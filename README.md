# ECO-Rise

ECO-RISE is a platfrom that allows for effective implementation of green walls on high-rise buildings. On our webiste: XXXX, the user inputs the building characteristics through the gamified interface. Pre-trained models analyze the four key parameters: green space connectivity, physical wall characteristics, sun exposure, and wind exposure. These are then fed into a collected spiking neural network model implemented in Python which is trained on sample buildings to predict the best green wall locations. The output is a matrix version of the building codified in binary to show locations reccomended for green walls, with a 1 representing a green wall ideal location, and a 0 representing a location not ideal for green walls.
